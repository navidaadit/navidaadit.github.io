I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of California, Santa Barbara** (expected Dec 2025). I work on **probabilistic computing** with p-bits and **extreme-scale distributed architectures** that connect ideas from **statistical physics**, **machine learning**, and **quantum-inspired optimization**.

My recent work scales probabilistic computers across multi-FPGA systems with delay-tolerant communication and balanced partitioning to sustain solution quality at unprecedented sizes.

**Keywords:** probabilistic computers; Ising/Boltzmann machines; multi-FPGA; Monte Carlo; energy-based models; quantum-inspired optimization.

## Research Highlights
- **Distributed probabilistic computing** — Architectures that interconnect heterogeneous hardware (multi-FPGA, neuromorphic, and emerging devices) over ultra‑low‑latency fabrics to reach 100k+ p‑bits.
- **Probabilistic AI & ML** — Using Ising/Boltzmann samplers for generative modeling, Bayesian inference, and scalable energy‑based learning.
- **Quantum‑inspired optimization** — Hardware–software co‑design blending stochastic p‑bit systems with quantum‑classical workflows for hard combinatorial problems.

## Selected Achievements
- *Massively Parallel Probabilistic Computing with Sparse Ising Machines* — **Nature Electronics**, 2022.
- **Bell Labs Prize (Bronze), 2023.**
- **Misha Mahowald Prize (Neuromorphic Engineering), 2025.**
