I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of California, Santa Barbara** (expected Fall 2025), specializing in **probabilistic computing** and **extreme-scale distributed architectures**. My research combines ideas from **statistical physics**, **machine learning**, and **quantum-inspired optimization** to push the limits of large-scale combinatorial problem solving.

Currently, I am an intern at **Siemens Digital Industries Software**, working on scaling probabilistic computers across multi-FPGA systems. My work targets scaling to **100,000+ probabilistic bits** with novel graph-partitioning techniques to minimize communication delay and maintain solution quality.
