I am **Navid Anjum Aadit**, a PhD candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the **University of California, Santa Barbara** (expected Dec 2025).  
I build **probabilistic computers** (Ising/Boltzmann) and **extreme-scale distributed architectures**, connecting ideas from **statistical physics**, **machine learning**, and **quantum-inspired optimization**.

My recent work scales p-computers across **multi-FPGA systems** with delay-tolerant communication and balanced partitioning to sustain solution quality at unprecedented sizes.

## Research Highlights
- **Distributed probabilistic computing** — Interconnect multi-FPGA/heterogeneous hardware over ultra-low-latency fabrics; 100k+ p-bits.
- **Probabilistic AI & ML** — Ising/Boltzmann samplers for generative modeling, Bayesian inference, and scalable energy-based learning.
- **Quantum-inspired optimization** — Hardware–software co-design blending stochastic p-bit systems with quantum-classical workflows.

## Selected Recognition
- **Nature Electronics (2022):** Massively parallel probabilistic computing with sparse Ising machines.  
- **Bell Labs Prize (Bronze, 2023).**  
- **Misha Mahowald Prize (2025).**
