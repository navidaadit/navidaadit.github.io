I am a PhD candidate in **Electrical & Computer Engineering** at the **University of California, Santa Barbara** (expected Dec 2025).

I work on **probabilistic computing** with p-bits and **extreme-scale distributed architectures**, connecting ideas from **statistical physics**, **machine learning**, and **quantum-inspired optimization**.

My recent work scales p-computers across **multi-FPGA systems** with delay-tolerant communication and balanced partitioning to sustain solution quality at unprecedented sizes.

## Research Highlights
- **Distributed probabilistic computing** ‚Äî Interconnect multi-FPGA / heterogeneous hardware over ultra-low-latency links; ~**1M p-bits** scaling.
- **Probabilistic AI & ML** ‚Äî Ising/Boltzmann samplers for generative AI, Bayesian inference, and scalable energy-based ML.
- **Quantum-inspired optimization** ‚Äî Hardware‚Äìsoftware co-design blending probabilistic systems with quantum-classical workflows.
