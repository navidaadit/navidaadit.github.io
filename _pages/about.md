intro: |
  I am **Navid Anjum Aadit**, a PhD Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of California, Santa Barbara** (expected Dec 2025).
  I work on **probabilistic computing** with p-bits and **extreme-scale distributed architectures** that connect ideas from **statistical physics**, **machine learning**, and **quantum-inspired optimization**.

  My recent work scales probabilistic computers across **multi-FPGA systems** with delay-tolerant communication and balanced partitioning to sustain solution quality at unprecedented sizes.
