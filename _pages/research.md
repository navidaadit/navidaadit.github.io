### Themes
- **Distributed probabilistic computing** — Interconnecting heterogeneous hardware (multi‑FPGA, neuromorphic, emerging devices) with ultra‑low‑latency fabrics.
- **Probabilistic AI & ML** — Ising/Boltzmann samplers for generative modeling, Bayesian inference, and scalable energy‑based learning.
- **Quantum‑inspired optimization** — Hardware–software co‑design that blends stochastic p‑bit systems with quantum‑classical workflows.

### Technical Threads
- Partitioning (Potts‑based) for balanced multi‑chip mapping
- Delay‑tolerant communication validated via energy/free‑energy metrics
- Non‑equilibrium Monte Carlo acceleration for hard spin‑glass instances
